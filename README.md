# Bon Voyage

## Created by Erica Wright and Sarah Leahy May 1st, 2017

  This website allows a user to interact with a google maps interface to get ideas on where they would like to travel. Once the user knows where they would like to go they can search for attractions by city. For example a user can look for museums in Hong Kong, or escape rooms in Denver. The site features a custom theme and was built in Drupal 7.
